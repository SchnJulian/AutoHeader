## Tired of adding your source-code header one by one to your projects?
![How it works](/Screenshots/Howitworks.png)



AutoHeader is a tool to add a „license-header“ to your projects. Adding each header individually can be annoying when dealing with large projects, especially when the comment has to be prepended to many files with various programming languages. With AutoHeader you just write your header, select your folder and the program automatically uses the right comment-style for every individual file.

## Reliability
After every execution you'll get a report .csv file, where every file is listed with a status, that helps you to determine wether the file was edited or skipped, because it had the wrong format (e.g. Images etc.)..

## Safe-mode
You can decide if AutoHeader overrides your files with the new version that includes the header or creates a folder with the edited files and keeps the old ones.
